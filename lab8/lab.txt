Part 1) Functional programming in JavaScript
Download http://cs.sjsu.edu/~austin/cs252-fall13/lab8/functional.js.
Implement the foldr, foldl, and map functions.
Write the curry method that we discussed in class and
use it to create a "double" function.

Part 2) Object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
Create a 'Student' constructor, like we did for Cat in class.
It should have the following fields:
*firstName
*lastName
*studentID
*display -- A function that prints out the firstName, lastName, and studentID number.
      To invoke it, you should call `student.display()`.

Create an array of new students.
Add a 'graduated' property to just one of your students.

Now create another student **without** using the constructor.
(In other words, use the object literal `{}` syntax).
Set the prototype chain manually using the __proto__ field.
Make sure the display method still works (without you having to add it to the object explicitly).
